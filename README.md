<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we delve into the vital processes of vulnerability scanning and remediation, integral components of the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. Leveraging Nessus Essentials, we'll conduct credentialed scans on local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation. Our objective is to uncover vulnerabilities, address them through remediation measures, and subsequently conduct rescan checks to validate the effectiveness of the remediation efforts. Through this hands-on approach, we aim to enhance our understanding of vulnerability management and fortify our defenses against potential security threats.

<br />
<br />
Download the Windows 10 ISO file, which contains the installation files for the Windows 10 operating system:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Download Nessus Essentials, a vulnerability scanner, to conduct security assessments and identify vulnerabilities in your systems and networks: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Set up the Windows 10 ISO file and create a virtual machine (VM) using virtualization software such as VMware Player: <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.16.45PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.16.45PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
Configure the Windows 10 virtual machine and navigate to the ISO file that we generated. This will initiate the installation process for Windows 10 on the virtual machine: <br/>

<br />
<br />
During the virtual machine setup, ensure to select "bridged" mode for the network adapter in the hardware settings. This configuration enables the virtual machine and the host PC to be on the same network, simplifying the scanning process for Nessus Essentials:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Boot the Windows 10 virtual machine and proceed with the setup process. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure and customize the Windows 10 installation according to your preferences:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Find the IPv4 address of the VM on Windows 10, then ping it from your PC to check connectivity:  <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.17.15PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.17.15PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
You may observe that the ping times out; this is typically caused by the firewalls configured on the VM:  <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.17.23PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.17.23PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
Turn off the Windows Firewall Defender on the VM, then retry the ping to check for connectivity: <br/>

<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.17.36PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.17.36PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
Open Nessus Essentials and initiate the creation of a new network scan:  <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.17.43PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.17.43PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
Once the network scan is set up, examine the initial scan results, which were conducted without using any credentials: <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.17.48PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.17.48PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
Navigate to the Services application on the virtual machine and enable Remote Registry. This action will facilitate the scanner's connection to the VM's registry, enabling the detection of insecure configurations: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Activate File and Printer Sharing on the VM to allow the sharing of files and printers over the network: <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.09PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.09PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
Access User Account Control settings on the virtual machine and adjust the notification level to "Never notify":  <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.13PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.13PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
Access the Registry Editor on the virtual machine and navigate to the specified directory provided by Nessus. Create a new DWORD file with the given name and set the value data to 1. After making this change, restart the VM for the settings to take effect:  <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.18PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.18PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
Proceed to Nessus Essentials and add the specified credentials. Once added, remember to save the changes:  <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.23PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.23PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
After allowing the scan to run for some time, you'll be able to observe the disparity in vulnerabilities detected before and after adding the credentials: <br/>
<br />
BEFORE:  <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.28PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.28PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
AFTER:  <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.32PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.32PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
Upon further examination of the vulnerabilities, Nessus Essentials offers solutions for critical issues, such as the one depicted below, providing actionable steps to address them effectively:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Download an outdated version of Firefox to conduct another scan, aiming to identify additional vulnerabilities before initiating the remediation process. <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.42PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.18.42PM.png" border="0" />
<br />
<br />
Restart the scan for a short duration and revisit the vulnerabilities. You should observe changes similar to the following:  <br/>
<img src="https://img.hotimg.com/Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.56.44PM.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-02-20-at-11.56.44PM.png" border="0" />

<br />
<br />
After reading the remediations, update and restart windows on the VM:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/SwPAmyP.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
Now run the scan once more and observe how the vulnerabilities and remediations decrease:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
This concludes the project on how to manage vulnerabilites using Nessus Essentials!  <br/>
